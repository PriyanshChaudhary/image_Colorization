# image_Colorization
In earlier times, converting a black and white image into a vibrant and acceptable modification was done by using survey and massive user feedback and interaction to produce a convincing output. However, the ensuing result turned out to be a unsaturated version of the what the real-life version of the image depicted. Here in this venture, the aim was to target the underlying issue of the problem which causes these unsaturated and non-vibrant colorization using Machine Learning. The complication here is handled by issuing the latent problem in the form of multiple classes and re-balancing the colors at the time when during training to increase the scope of the usage of varied colors in the results.
